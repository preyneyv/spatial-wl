# Spatial Wayland Compositor

True spatial computing using the XREAL Air glasses and a Wayland-powered 
compositor based on wlroots and OpenGL.

## Foreword

This is my first actual C project (other than tiny homework assignments in 
college), so the code may not be peak optimality. I've also never done OpenGL 
before, so... be warned.
